probably not up-to-date

My terminal is Konsole, using a fully [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)-patched 
[Fira Code font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) forged to have normal `&` signs.

I use [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-konsole) theme.

I probably use a lot of scripts or snippets I didn't write.

I'm using `zsh` as my main personal shell, with the [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) prompt.

All of this is running on an Arch Linux laptop with the KDE Plasma desktop environment.
